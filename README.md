# Data-visualiser
MMP project
This project formed part of my BSc Computer Science final year project.

The aim of this project was to create a program that adheres to the Principles of mental
model and Shneiderman’s 8 Golden Rules. These principles will help guide the program to
be user friendly and intuitive. The program should be able to process data in csv files and
give useful information about the data imported. The information given can be statistical or
graphical.

The program is implemented using Java and the User interface is done using Javafx. This
allows the program to be standalone and can be used on any major operating systems
(macOS, Windows, linux).

The statistical information includes:

For numerical data
• Type of data
• Summation
• Mean
• Variance
• Standard deviation
• Median
• Minimum and maximum value
• Pearson’s correlation coefficient
• Analysis of variance
• Missing values

For categorical data
• Type of data
• Distinct records and their frequency
• Missing values

These statistical information can be saved in a txt file on the local or an external hardrive.
The data can be represented on graphs; pie charts, bar charts, line charts or scatter charts.
These charts will only be displayed depending on the type of data in the columns selected
by the user.

The outcome of this project is a user-friendly data visualizing program, that allows data to
be analyzed with a few clicks. There were a lot of challenges to overcome, especially with
the user interface.
